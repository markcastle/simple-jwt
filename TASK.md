## Notes
- Tasks should be implemented in order of priority
- Each task should include both happy path and error cases
- All tests should be documented with clear descriptions
- Test coverage should be maintained at >90% for critical and high priority items
- New tasks discovered during implementation should be added to appropriate priority levels

## Progress Tracking
- Total Tasks: 65
- Completed Tasks: 42
- Critical Priority: 24/24
- High Priority: 15/15
- Medium Priority: 0/20
- Low Priority: 0/10
